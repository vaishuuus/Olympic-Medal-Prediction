# Olympic-Medal-Prediction
First Repository, first project.
This is a machine learning project that forecasts the total medal count for countries participating in the Olympic Games.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple regression model to predict how many medals a country will win. The model is trained on historical Olympic data.

The process involved:
* **Data Cleaning:** Used **Pandas** to clean and prepare the dataset.
* **Feature Engineering:** Selected relevant features (like number of athletes, GDP, past performance) to train the model.
* **Model Training:** Trained a **Linear Regression** model using **Scikit-learn**.
* **Model Evaluation:** Checked the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation and cleaning)
* **Scikit-learn** (for building the model)
* **Matplotlib** (for data visualisation)
* **Google Colab**

## How to Use

You can view the complete analysis and code by opening the `.ipynb` notebook file in this repository.
